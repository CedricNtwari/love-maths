## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript-only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript-only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py`, of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere, you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
